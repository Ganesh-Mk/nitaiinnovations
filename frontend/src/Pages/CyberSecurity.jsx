        description=" Cybersecurity penetration testing, also known as ethical hacking,
              is a process used to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in
              a system. By simulating cyberattacks, penetration testers uncover
              weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious hackers. This
              proactive approach helps organizations protect their networks,
              applications, and data, ensuring they remain secure against
              potential threats. Regular penetration testing is essential for
              maintaining a strong cybersecurity posture in an increasingly
              digital world."

          Penetration testing, often referred to as pen testing, is a proactive
          security assessment that simulates real-world cyberattacks to identify
          weaknesses in your systems, applications, and networks. By uncovering
          potential vulnerabilities before malicious actors do, penetration
          testing helps you strengthen your defenses and protect your sensitive
          data.
